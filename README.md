# 3MTT US COVID 19 prediction capstone project

## Aim of the project
To use historical COVID-19 data to develop predictive models to forecast COVID-19 trends in the United States. 
This project will provide **Health Guard Analytics** with actionable insights to inform policies, anticipate future outbreaks, and improve health resource allocation. 

### Objectives:
1. To perform data preprocessing to ensure that the data is clean and normalized for the ML model
2. To perform EDA on the data to uncover relevant trends and correlations/relationships
3. To build and train a model that can forecast future COVID-19 trends

## Data Preparation:
The source of data for this capstone project contained 6 <a href = "https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/imdevskp/corona-virus-report">dataset</a>;
1. Worldometer_data
2. Country_wise_latest
3. Full_grouped
4. USA_country_wise
5. Day_wise
6. COVID-19_clean_complete

Out of the six datasets, two (COVID-19_clean_complete and Full_grouped) were selected because they were relevant to helping me achieve my project aims and objectives. 

The details of the project are summarized in this <a href = "https://github.com/Etini2000/3MTT_capstone_US/blob/main/Capstone%20Technical%20Report.docx">technical report</a>.
